# FitnessFood
## A web application that has different functions for the user based around food.

Skills implemented in this project:

-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-SCSS

This project is a web application, using web API's as well as CRUD.


My project has four pages:

-A home page
-A nutrition checker
-A calorie tracker
-A recipe searcher

The home page has the navbar of course, to navigate between the dfferent web pages. It also has brief information on what the project is about as well as some of my personal contact information.

The nutrition checker presents the user with a nutrition label of the inputted food item. It utilizes an API, fetching the different label values and displaying them.

The calorie checker allows the user to input a food item as well as the calories it contains. It uses CRUD; so the user can create (create a food item with it calories), read (read their calroic intake), update (change the values or food item name if theyd like) as well as delete (they can delete a label if theyd like).

The recipe searcher allows the user to search a recipe. The searchbar can search for a recipe by its name or a recipe by an ingredient it contains. It will present the user with 10 recipies. It does this by using an API, fetching data.

What I would like to improve:
-Use a framework like NodeJS for API management
-Re write project in Javascript framework such as ReactJS
-UI/UX design
